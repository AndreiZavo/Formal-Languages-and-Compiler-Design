The symbol table implemented contains:
	- it has a size as its field and the list of elements that is represented as a HashMap
	- in the HashMap, the key is the index of each elements in the table and the value represents the bucket of elements
	- in the constructor we initialize the corresponding size and the HashMap. Each value is represented as a list of objects
	(in the bucket corresponding to each element, is the position on which it appears)
	 - hashFunction computes the hash function by summing the ascii codes from the string
	- the find function returns the position of an element in its bucket
	- add returns the result of the hashFunction if the element already exists or puts it in the bucket if it doesn't
