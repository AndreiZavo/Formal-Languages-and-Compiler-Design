Lab 3

Regarding the tables, in addition to the symbol table created for the previous laboratory, now there is 
also the PIF table which has its own class.

The PIF class has a symbol table and a list of pairs. Each pair is a string, which is the element from the
code and another pair consisting of two integers. That two integers represent the reference in the symbol 
table.

For reading and writing from a file we have three functions that get content from the initial files and 
other two which write to the files regarding the PIF table and Symbol table.

In the Scanner folder are three classes. In the Validation class we check what type is a word. It can be 
an identifier, a constant or a reserved word. To check if it’s an identifier, first it must not appear in 
the reserved words and characters list and then to be in a correct form. The correct form is checked with 
regex. Similarly, we check if it’s a constant: verify it’s not in the reserved list check if it’s the 
word “true” or “false” and then validate its type. It can be a number, a string or a char.

The Scanner class has one function that verifies and adds the tokens to the PIF and the Symbol Table. 
It does that by checking every token its type and based on that it adds it where it should be. 
If the token is not an identifier, or a constant, or a reserved word then an error it is shown.
